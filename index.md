# Maria Heuss

I am an Assistant Professor at the  Information Retrieval Lab ([IRLab](https://irlab.science.uva.nl/about/)) of the University of Amsterdam ([UvA])(https://uva.nl). My research focuses on responsible advice giving systems. During my PhD at the UvA I did research on fairness and interpretability in information retrieval under the supervision of supervised by [Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke) and [Avishek Anand](https://www.avishekanand.com). My PhD was funded by the [Hybrid Intelligence Center](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl). My MSc and BSc are both in mathematics from [Univeristy of Freiburg](https://uni-freiburg.de/en/) in Germany.

<!-- # Background

Intrigued by patterns and puzzles from a young age, I pursued Mathematics at Freiburg, earning my Bachelor's degree  (with a final grade of 2.2, where 1 is the best and 4 is the passing minimum) and my Master's degree (with a final grade of 1.1) including two Erasmus exchange years in Utrecht, the Netherlands. My Master's research was primarily in pure mathematics, focusing on algebraic topics. After completing my studies, I shifted my focus to Artificial Intelligence, seeing it as a field where I could have a more direct impact.  I interned as a data-scientist at Green-Pocket and worked as a Deep Learning Scientist at Plumerai, researching binarized neural networks, before deciding to return to academia.


# Advocating for Diversity and Inclusion

Driven by personal experiences and the stories of others, I have made it my mission to improve working environment for individuals from minority groups and those who struggle in the prevailing work environments of our field. I aim to raise awareness about the diverse needs and working styles of individuals and actively contribute to shaping a more inclusive culture within my current group. Additionally, I organize meetups for women and gender minorities in AI several times a year. I am eager to learn more about the experiences and challenges of others that I may not yet be aware of. -->
